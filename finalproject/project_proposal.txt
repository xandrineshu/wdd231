Horror Games club?? "Terror Tested" "The Fear Review"
"Fear File" "The Terror Trove"


=====================================================

Project Description

Fear File is a web development project designed
as a comprehensive review platform for horror video games.
The site's purpose is to provide in-depth critical analysis
and a searchable database to help both casual players and
dedicated fans discover their next terrifying experience.

=====================================================

Project Reason and Purpose

The project's primary purpose is to address a clear
need within the gaming community: to provide a centralized and
reliable platform for in-depth horror game analysis.
While many review sites exist, few specialize in exploring 
the nuanced elements of horror, such as psychological dread,
atmosphere, and narrative. Fear File aims to be the go-to
resource for enthusiasts seeking a curated guide to the genre.
